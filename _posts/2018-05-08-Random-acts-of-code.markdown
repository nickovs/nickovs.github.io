I don't often get the urge to talk about the code that I've written
but it does happens every so often. Combined with an interest in
playing with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) I decieded to
set up this site to give it a try.

Anyway, this is probably not going to end up a high volume blog site
but hopefully some people will find some of what I post to be of interest.
